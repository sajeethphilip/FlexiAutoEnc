Designing a custom autoencoder from a configuration file is a great idea! It allows you to easily experiment with different architectures without modifying the code. 
You can use a configuration text file to generate JSON or YAML file to define the architecture, including the number of layers, types of layers, kernel sizes, 
strides, and input image size. Then, it will generate a PyTorch model that dynamically builds the autoencoder based on the configuration.
